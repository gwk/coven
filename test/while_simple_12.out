Coverage Report:

__main__: while_simple_{}.py:
   6     Python 3.10 duplicates the `while` test at the beginning and end of the loop.
   7     Complete coverage requires that both branches of both tests are exercised.
   8     Thus i=0 and i=1 are not enough for complete code covereage, but i=0 and i=2 are.

__main__: while_simple_{}.py: 8 traceable; 7 covered; 0 ignored; 0 ignored but covered; 1 not covered.
